I am writing an options recommending algorithm that takes premarket data as well as 9:30-10:00 data to make a decision on what options to buy at 10:15AM.

I plan on getting the following metrics, from a mix of yahoo finance and alpaca API:

Premarket Structure

premarket_pct_change

premarket_range_pct

premarket_last_price

premarket_high

premarket_low

premarket_vwap

distance_from_premarket_vwap_pct (9:20 and 9:30)

pm_trend_slope_pct_per_hour

pm_pullback_depth_pct

Volume

premarket_volume_60m

relative_volume_20d

opening_volume_spike_factor

Opening (9:30–10:00)

price_930

price_1000

move_930_to_1000_pct

opening_range_high

opening_range_low

opening_vwap_930_1000

price_1000_vs_opening_vwap

price_1000_vs_premarket_vwap

rsi_1min_at_1000

macd_hist_5m_at_1000

higher_highs_9_30_to_10_00
